# cube

## Overview

This is meant to be a learning progject of building a container orchetrator with two purposes: 

### 1. Understand kubernetes

Kuberenetes is a large complex technology and implementations of it are only growing more complex. Diving into the conceptual core points of it and building an architecture myself will provide a better understanding of how it works. It will also provide a platform to experiement and learn from myself. 

### 2. Learn Go Programming

As a personal goal, i would like to become a softare engineer and the GO language is an attractive option for the type of work I like to do. As kubernetes is built in Go, this is a great opportunity to have a solid overlapping learning project that is beneficial in many areas.
